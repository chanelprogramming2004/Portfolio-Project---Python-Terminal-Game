# Portfolio-Project---Python-Terminal-Game
This project is a simple quiz program that tests your general knowledge. It presents a series of multiple-choice questions and allows you to select an option as your answer. At the end of the quiz, it provides feedback on your performance by displaying the number of correct answers you provided.

To access this project, please follow these steps:

1. Copy the code provided into a Python file with a .py extension (e.g., quiz.py).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
   
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.

4. Run the program by executing the following command: python quiz.py (or python3 quiz.py if you're using Python 3).

Once the program starts running, it will display each question along with multiple-choice options. You can enter the letter corresponding to your chosen option (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D') as your answer. After you've answered all the questions, the program will provide feedback on the number of correct answers you provided.

As this is my first project, feedback is greatly appreciated. Feel free to experiment with the code, make changes, and explore different features. This is an excellent opportunity to learn and enhance your programming skills. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
